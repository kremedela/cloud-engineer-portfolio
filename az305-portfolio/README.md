🏗️ Azure Solutions Architect Portfolio (AZ-305)

"Architecture isn’t about choosing the right service — it’s about designing the right solution."

👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Euron Pennyman, a Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert (AZ-305) passionate about transforming business challenges into cloud-native, scalable, and secure architectures.

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to design end-to-end Azure solutions that balance performance, cost, security, and reliability — all while aligning with business objectives and operational realities.

I believe in architecture as strategy: designing solutions that empower people, accelerate innovation, and deliver measurable outcomes.

🧠 Architectural Mindset

As an architect, I focus on:

Designing secure and resilient multi-tier architectures

Leveraging cloud-native services for scalability and cost optimization

Integrating governance, identity, and compliance into every design

Enabling DevOps and automation for consistent delivery

Aligning architecture decisions with business and technical KPIs

“Great architecture anticipates change — and makes it effortless.”

💡 Architecture Philosophy

My architectural philosophy is built on three pillars:

Simplicity scales — the simplest solution is often the most reliable.

Design with intent — every decision should tie back to a measurable goal.

Secure by default — compliance and security are not add-ons; they are embedded.

“Architecture is the story of how technology meets purpose — responsibly and elegantly.”
