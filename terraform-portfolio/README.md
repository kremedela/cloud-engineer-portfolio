🌍 Terraform Portfolio (Azure Focused)

“Infrastructure as code isn’t just automation — it’s the blueprint for reliable, scalable, and secure cloud systems.”

👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Euron Pennyman, a Terraform Certified Associate and Infrastructure-as-Code specialist with a focus on Azure cloud environments.

I design and implement scalable, secure, and automated cloud infrastructures using Terraform, enabling organizations to provision and manage Azure resources efficiently. While Azure is my primary focus, I also have experience with AWS and GCP, allowing me to deliver multi-cloud solutions when needed.

My approach is guided by best practices in IaC, modular design, and automation, ensuring that infrastructure is repeatable, auditable, and resilient. I view Terraform not just as a tool, but as a strategic lever for modern cloud operations.

🌐 Portfolio Overview

This repository showcases Terraform projects, modules, and best practices, demonstrating:

Designing modular and reusable Terraform code for cloud environments

Provisioning Azure infrastructure including networking, compute, storage, and identity

Integrating CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments

Managing infrastructure lifecycle using Terraform Cloud, remote state, and version control

Applying security, compliance, and governance principles across multi-cloud setups

Each project includes architecture diagrams, Terraform code samples, and deployment documentation, highlighting both technical skills and strategic thinking.

💡 Infrastructure Philosophy

My approach to Terraform and cloud infrastructure is guided by:

Code is infrastructure — every resource is versioned, testable, and auditable.

Automation reduces risk — repeatable deployments minimize human error.

Modularity and scalability — infrastructure grows with business needs, with Azure at the core.

“Terraform turns cloud architecture into predictable, repeatable, and secure code, with Azure as the foundation.”

🌱 Future Focus

I am expanding my Terraform expertise with:

Advanced Azure-native IaC modules for complex enterprise environments

Integration of policy-as-code and automated compliance

Scalable multi-cloud deployments with Azure first, AWS/GCP secondary

Automated testing and drift detection across environments
