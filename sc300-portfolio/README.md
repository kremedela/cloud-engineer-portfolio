🛡️ Identity & Access Management Portfolio (SC-300)

“Identity is the foundation of security — when it’s managed well, everything else follows.”

👋 About Me

Hi, I’m Euron Pennyman, a Microsoft Certified Identity and Access Administrator (SC-300) dedicated to designing and implementing secure, scalable identity solutions.

I specialize in Azure Active Directory, Conditional Access, and Zero Trust security, helping organizations protect digital assets while enabling seamless access for users. My focus is on reducing risk, enforcing governance, and streamlining authentication across cloud and hybrid environments.

I view identity not just as credentials — but as the foundation of trust, security, and productivity in modern enterprise ecosystems.

🌐 Portfolio Overview

This repository showcases practical projects, configurations, and labs aligned with the SC-300 certification objectives and real-world enterprise identity challenges.

Each project demonstrates:

Architecture and workflow diagrams for identity and access solutions

Policy configuration and deployment in Azure AD

Security design considerations and trade-offs

Automation scripts and monitoring strategies

🧩 Core Focus Areas

Identity Management

User, group, and device lifecycle management

Hybrid identity using Azure AD Connect

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and delegated administration

Access Management

Conditional Access policies and MFA enforcement

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time access

Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with cloud and on-premises apps

Authentication & Security

Passwordless authentication with FIDO2, Microsoft Authenticator, Windows Hello

Identity Protection and risk-based policies

Zero Trust principles applied across environments

Monitoring & Governance

Audit logging, reporting, and alerting with Azure AD and Microsoft Sentinel

Secure Score and compliance monitoring

Access reviews and automated governance processes

🎓 Certification Alignment

This portfolio aligns with the Microsoft Certified: Identity and Access Administrator Associate (SC-300) exam objectives:

Implement an identity management solution

Implement an authentication and access management solution

Implement access management for apps

Plan and implement identity governance

📘 Each project includes:

Architecture diagrams and design notes

Policy configurations and security models

Deployment scripts and testing documentation

Risk assessment and compliance considerations

💡 Identity Philosophy

My approach to identity and access management is guided by three principles:

Secure by design — every identity decision reduces risk without blocking productivity.

Automation first — repeatable processes ensure compliance, efficiency, and scalability.

User-centric security — secure access should be seamless, intuitive, and minimally disruptive.

“Managing identity isn’t about control — it’s about enabling secure access with confidence.”

🌱 Future Focus

I am actively expanding my SC-300 expertise through:

Advanced conditional access scenarios for complex enterprise environments

Identity protection using Microsoft Sentinel and automated risk analytics

Lifecycle automation for hybrid and multi-cloud environments

Integration of Azure AD with SaaS apps at scale
